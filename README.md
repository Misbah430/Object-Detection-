# Object-Detection-

This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using the YOLOv8 model. The system can detect and track various objects in a video stream, estimate their speed, and display the count of moving and stationary objects.

Features

•	Real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8.
•	Speed estimation of moving objects in meters per second (m/s).
•	Display of the count of moving and stationary objects.
•	Resizing of video frames for better visualization.

Requirements

•	Python 3.7 or higher
•	Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt
